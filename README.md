The Phishing Detection Dashboard is a web application that detects phishing threats using a RandomForestClassifier. Built with Flask and MySQL, it allows users to input URLs for real-time analysis and logs results for reference. The system enhances cybersecurity by providing an intuitive interface for detecting malicious websites. It can be extended to analyze phishing attempts in emails and SMS. Future enhancements include improving model accuracy, integrating browser extensions, and expanding detection capabilities for better threat prevention.
Role I played:
I developed the Phishing Detection Dashboard, building the Flask backend, integrating the RandomForestClassifier, and managing MySQL database operations. I optimized model performance, enhanced the user interface, and ensured smooth deployment. Additionally, I troubleshot issues and planned future upgrades like browser extensions and expanded phishing detection for email.
Languages Used:
The Phishing Detection Dashboard was developed using the following languages:
•	Python – For backend development with Flask and machine learning model integration.
•	HTML, CSS, JavaScript – For the frontend interface.
•	SQL (MySQL) – For database management and storing analyzed URLs.
